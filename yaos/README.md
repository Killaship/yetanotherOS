Yet Another OS

This is attempt 2 at OS development. This time, I'll at least try to have a decent amount of working stuff, and skip the crappy kernelspace shell that I have.

# Basic idea
OSdev 2: gcc-erroring boogaloo. That's it. I just want the OS to get past being a clock. (No really, my first kernel's best feature was that it could read the time from the RTC.)

# Goals

1. Not fail
2. a working memory manager
3. program loading via grub modules
4. elf support
5. filesystem of some kind
6. userland and syscalls
