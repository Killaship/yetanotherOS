Yet Another OS

This is attempt 2 at OS development. This time, I'll at least try to have a decent amount of working stuff, and skip the crappy kernelspace shell that I have.

# Basic idea
OSdev 2: gcc-erroring boogaloo. That's it. I just want the OS to get past being a clock. (No really, my first kernel's best feature was that it could read the time from the RTC.)

# Goals

1. Not fail
2. a working memory manager
3. program loading
4. elf or some other executable format support
5. filesystem of some kind
6. userland and syscalls

(these goals may or may not be in chronological order.)
